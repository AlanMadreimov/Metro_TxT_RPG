My head is buzzing like a twisted starter. There is an annoying ringing in my ears, mixed with the distant screech of metal. Fragments of the past come up before my eyes:
Grandpa's Volga in the village barn. The summer heat, the dust in the beam of the lantern, and the old man grumbles: "Don't turn off the gas in vain â€” the bearings are not iron." His hands were covered in grease, and the carburetor was repaired for the first time in his life.
A car market on the outskirts of the city. The customer points his finger at the steaming engine: "You gave me a guarantee!" His own grin: "There was a guarantee until you forgot to change the oil."
His last clear memory was a flash on the horizon when he was digging under the hood of an old UAZ. The fiery wind tore off his cap and showered him with glass. Thought: "What a hack... Who paints bodies like that?"
Now it's spinning in my head: "The main thing is to find a toolbox. And there... at least fix a tank, at least assemble a wheelbarrow."
